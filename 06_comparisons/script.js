/**
 * * Comparisons
 * They include:
 * Greater/less than: a > b, a < b
 * Greater/less than or equals: a >= b, a <= b.
 * Equals: a == b, please note the double equality sign == means the equality test, while a single one a = b means an assignment.
 * Not equals: it’s written as a != b.
 * 
 * * All comparison operators return a boolean value:
 * true – means “yes”, “correct” or “the truth”.
 * false – means “no”, “wrong” or “not the truth”.
 * 
 * * String comparison
 * JavaScript uses the so-called “dictionary” or “lexicographical” order.
 * strings are compared letter-by-letter.
 * 
 * * Strict equality
 * A strict equality operator === checks the equality without type conversion.
 * There is also a “strict non-equality” operator !== analogous to !=.
