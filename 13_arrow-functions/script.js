/**
 * * Arrow functions
 * it's a simple and concise syntax for creating functions.
 * 
 * * Syntax
 * let func = (arg1, arg2, ..., argN) => expression;
 * 
 * * Example
 * let sum = (a, b) => a + b;
 * 
 * console.log( sum(1, 2) );
 * 
 * If we have only one argument, then parentheses around parameters can be omitted, making that even shorter.
 * If there are no arguments, parentheses are empty, but they must be present
 * * Example
 * let sayHi = () => alert("Hello!");
 * 
 * sayHi();
 *
